              <h3>Password Attempt Rates</h1>
              <p>
                The value of <strong>R</strong> (the rate of password attempts per
                second) for a normal computer can vary significantly depending on
                the hardware and the specific attack method used. Here's a rough
                estimate based on different types of computers and attack methods:
              </p>
    
              <h4>1. Average Personal Computer:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>CPU-based brute force attack:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Older or lower-end CPUs: 1,000 - 10,000 attempts per second
                    </li>
                    <li>Modern CPUs: 100,000 - 1,000,000 attempts per second</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
    
              <h4>2. High-Performance Gaming PC:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>GPU-based brute force attack:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Using a mid-range GPU (e.g., NVIDIA GTX 1660): 10,000,000 -
                      100,000,000 attempts per second
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Using a high-end GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3080): 100,000,000 -
                      1,000,000,000 attempts per second
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
    
              <h3>3. Specialized Hardware or Botnets:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>High-end GPUs or FPGA/ASIC-based systems:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Specialized hardware like FPGAs or ASICs can achieve
                      1,000,000,000 - 10,000,000,000 attempts per second or more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Large botnets comprising thousands of compromised machines can
                      collectively achieve very high rates of password attempts.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
    
              <h3>4. Online Attacks:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Limited by network latency and server defenses:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Typically much slower due to rate limiting and lockout
                      mechanisms: 1 - 1,000 attempts per second
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
    
              <p>
                For an average modern personal computer with a decent CPU, a rough
                estimate would be around 100,000 to 1,000,000 attempts per second.
                However, using a powerful GPU can increase this rate significantly.
