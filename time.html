              To estimate the time required to break a password, you need to
              consider the method used by attackers, such as brute force attacks.
              Here’s a simplified approach to calculate the time required to break a
              password:
              <br /><br />
              <strong>1. Determine the Search Space:</strong><br />
              The search space is the total number of possible combinations for a
              given password. It can be calculated using the formula:<br />
              N = C^L <br />
              where:<br />
              N = Total number of possible combinations<br />
              C = Number of possible characters in the character set<br />
              L= Length of the password
              <br /><br />
              <strong>2. Character Set Size:</strong><br />
              The size of the character set depends on what characters are used in
              the password:<br />
              - Lowercase letters (a-z): 26<br />
              - Uppercase letters (A-Z): 26<br />
              - Digits (0-9): 10<br />
              - Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $): typically around 32 (varies
              based on allowed characters)
              <br /><br />
              For example, if a password uses lowercase and uppercase letters,
              digits, and special characters, the character set size is:<br />
              C = 26 + 26 + 10 + 32 = 94
              <br /><br />
              <strong>3. Compute the Search Space:</strong><br />
              For a password of length (L) :<br />
              N = 94^L
              <br /><br />
    
              <strong>4. Brute Force Attack Speed:</strong> <br />
              Assume the attacker can make R attempts per second. The time 𝑇 to
              exhaustively search the entire space is:<br />
              𝑇 = 𝑁/𝑅 ​<br />
              <br />
    
              <strong>5. Lets perform a case</strong>
              <p>
                let L be 10, L is length of password, assuming the attacker can make
                1 billion attempts per second.
              </p>
              𝑁 = 94^10 ≈ 5.39 × 10^19 Seconds <br />
              𝑅 = 10^9 attacks per second
              <br />
    
              <p>
                In Years time will be equal to: 1,710 years <br />
                𝑇 = 1,710 years
              </p>
    
              <br /><br />
              <strong>Notes:</strong><br />
              - <strong>Password Strength:</strong> Stronger passwords with higher
              character variety and length increase the search space
              exponentially.<br />
              - <strong>Attack Speed:</strong> Modern GPUs and botnets can
              significantly increase the rate of attempts, so always consider
              realistic attack speeds.<br />
              - <strong>Password Policies:</strong> Enforcing complex password
              policies helps in increasing the search space, making brute force
